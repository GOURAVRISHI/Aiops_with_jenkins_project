## 🚀 Problem Statement

```
Create an End to End Machine Learning architecture which includes 
Model Training, Testing and operationalization, 
Infrastructure and endpoint monitoring.
```

### ✨ Architecture
![test drawio (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40850370/166421284-ae6e632f-2633-4f7a-b1be-8538ebab6b42.png)

### 🔥 Technologies Used
``` 
1. Python 
2. shell scripting 
3. aws cloud Provider 
4. Prometheus And grafana
5. FastApi for endpoint 
6. S3bucket - as feature store and model registry 
7. CI-CD tool Jenkins
```

## 👷 Initial Setup 
```commandline
conda create --prefix ./env python=3.9
conda activate ./env 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
## 💭 Setup S3 bucket
```
1. Feature Store s3 bucket with lambda call on put event
2. Model Registry - Testing 
                  - production
```
### 🔅 Configuration for jenkins

```
Install jenkins on ec2 and make a webhook with github repository to access it whenever updated on push.
Create 3 jobs Train, Test and Deploy. While creating Seperate jobs remember to put jenkins-jobs-script in it.
I have written 3 sepreate script in it.

Create a master pipeline to run different train,test and deploy.
```
## 📐 Develop Lambda Trigger

```
Create Lambda Trigger on S3 Feature store on put event, use python3.7 in lambda as it has request library pre-installed
Remote trigger Master pipeline to run all the stages.
```
### 📊 Configuration File
```
Maintain Configuration file. Changes required in 
- Feature-Store
- Model Registry 
- Email Params
    - Please put gmail application key in it else you will get error
- Ml_Model_params
```

### ✏️ Configuration for Prometheus

```
Install prometheus on Ec2 machine. In configuration file add scrape job set in endpoints.

 
  - job_name: "python_endpoint"
  
    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:5000"]
      
  - job_name: "wmi_exporter"
  
    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9182"]

```
### 📉 Configuration for Grafana

```
Install grafana and it will run on port 3000 by default.
Configure prometheus in it and create monetoring dash board.
```
